## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What I most learned on this particular project is to use CSS Flexbox.

- I learned how to change a `display: block` element to `display: flex`, even when its child elements maintain their default block behavior.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: space-evenly;
}
```

### Continued development

I feel that there is still room for improvement in my understanding of certain concepts. Specifically, I would like to gain a better grasp on the Mobile-first workflow, CSS Grid Layout Module, and Flexbox.

1.  **Mobile-first design** means starting with the mobile version of a website or app, then scaling up to larger screens. This prioritizes smaller screens, which have limited real estate and processing power.

2.  **CSS Grid Layout Module** is a flexible and powerful layout system for web pages. It lets designers create grid-based layouts easily, making it an alternative to traditional methods like floats and positioning. With CSS Grid, designers can create responsive layouts that adapt to different screens and orientations.

3.  **Flexbox** is a layout system for web pages that lets designers easily align and distribute space among items in a container. It's a flexible and efficient way to control the layout of elements both horizontally and vertically, making it perfect for responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations.
